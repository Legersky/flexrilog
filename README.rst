FlexRiLoG - Flexible and Rigid Labelings of Graphs
===================================================


This is a SageMath package providing functionality for investigating flexible and rigid labelings of graphs.
It implements the concepts described in the papers
*Graphs with Flexible Labelings* (doi:`10.1007/s00454-018-0026-9 <https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00454-018-0026-9>`_)
and *Graphs with Flexible Labelings allowing Injective Realizations*
(arXiv:`1811.06709 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06709>`_) by Georg Grasegger, Jan Legerský and Josef Schicho,
and in the doctoral thesis *Flexible and Rigid Labelings of Graphs* by Jan Legerský.

For the definitions of a flexible and rigid labeling and other implemented concepts,
see the Jupyter notebook ``examples/FlexRiLoG_demo.ipynb``.
You can try it out online without installation:

Installation
-----------------

Download or clone the source code from `github.com/Legersky/flexrilog <https://github.com/Legersky/flexrilog>`_ and run

``make install``

The documentation can be found `online <https://jan.legersky.cz/doc/FlexRiLoG/>`_ or generated by 

``make doc``

Test the code by

``make test``

or

``make test-all``

For some functions, the package `phcpy <http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~jan/phcpy_doc_html/welcome.html>`_ must be installed.
