FlexRiLoG - Flexible and Rigid Labelings of Graphs
===================================================


This is a SageMath package providing functionality for investigating flexible and rigid labelings of graphs.
It implements the concepts described in the doctoral thesis *Flexible and Rigid Labelings of Graphs* by Jan Legersk√Ω.
